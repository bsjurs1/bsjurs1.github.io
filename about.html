                    Beam uses Google Firebase to collect anonymized usage data to improve the user experience of the
                    app. The data that is collected is aggregate statistics surrounding task and task list creation
                    frequency, task completion frequency and task editing frequency. Other meta data is gathered such as device OS version, number of times the app is opened, and number of times the app is closed. The gathered data can not be put in
                    context with any individual, and is completely anonymous.
